# Lights

Playing around with individually addressable LEDs

## The hardware

- 10x LED strips
  - 1 meter long each
  - 144 LEDs per strip
  - WS2812 LEDs
  
- 1x Arduino Due
  - 32-bit ARM-M3 clocked at 84mHz. 
  - 96 KB SRAM

- 2x "Alitov" 5V/10A transformers for power

## The software? in this repo!
- [Platform.io](http://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/ide/atom.html)
- [FastLED](https://github.com/FastLED/FastLED) (exceedingly convienent for HSV colors on these LEDs, versus RGB)

## Pics, Video (TODO.... lol)
